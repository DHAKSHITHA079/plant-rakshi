## Core Functionality

### PlantCareAssistant Class
The main application class that handles all functionality:

#### Key Methods
- `init()`: Initializes the application and binds events
- `addPlant()`: Handles form submission and plant creation
- `deletePlant()`: Removes plants with user confirmation
- `renderPlants()`: Updates the plant display grid
- `renderCalendar()`: Generates the 30-day calendar view
- `getWateringEventsForDate()`: Calculates watering schedules
- `loadPlantsFromStorage()` / `savePlantsToStorage()`: Data persistence

### Data Structure
```javascript
Plant Object:
{
  id: "timestamp_string",
  name: "Plant Name",
  type: "Plant Type",
  frequency: number, // days between watering
  photo: "base64_string" | null,
  dateAdded: "ISO_date_string"
}
```

### Calendar Logic
- Calculates days since plant was added
- Uses modulo operation to determine watering days
- Generates 30-day view starting from current date
- Displays multiple plants per day when schedules overlap

## User Experience Features

### Form Validation
- Required field validation
- Numeric input constraints (1-30 days)
- File type validation for photos
- Real-time feedback and error messages

### Interactive Elements
- Hover effects on all clickable elements
- Smooth transitions and animations
- Loading states and success messages
- Confirmation dialogs for destructive actions

### Accessibility
- Semantic HTML structure
- Proper form labels and associations
- Keyboard navigation support
- Screen reader friendly content
- High contrast color combinations

### Responsive Design
- Mobile-first approach
- Flexible grid layouts
- Scalable typography
- Touch-friendly interface elements
- Optimized for screens 320px to 1200px+

## Browser Compatibility

- Error handling for storage limitations

## Performance Considerations

### Optimization Strategies
- **Image Handling:** Base64 conversion with size considerations
- **DOM Manipulation:** Efficient rendering with innerHTML batching
